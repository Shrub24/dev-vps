# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Bring up and operate a clear, reproducible, low-complexity first NixOS host that establishes the right foundation for future fleet growth.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — repository-cutover

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (repository-cutover) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: 0 min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none
- Trend: Stable

| Phase 01 P01 | 10 min | 2 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Remove legacy `dev-vps` framing and make the fleet repo shape authoritative.
- Phase 2: Keep secrets split between `secrets/common.yaml` and `hosts/<host>/secrets.yaml` with explicit `.sops.yaml` scoping.
- Phase 3: Bootstrap with `nixos-anywhere` and keep services private and Tailscale-only.
- Phase 4: Start with direct Syncthing-to-Navidrome media flow and safety controls.
- [Phase 01]: Use oci-melb-1 as canonical flake output and host boundary now
- [Phase 01]: Remove legacy package/Home Manager host wiring from active flake composition

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Validate OCI ARM bootstrap specifics and stable device mapping before execution.
- Phase 3: Keep serial-console break-glass posture documented before Tailscale becomes the primary admin path.
- Phase 4: Define acceptable Syncthing conflict/delete recovery posture before calling the baseline stable.
